        Placing html tags or components is not challenging if one has 
        conceptual understading of CSS options of placing elements. 
        
        Flex and Grids layout are saviours for 
        faster development 

        The challenge in the frontend is (user engagement)
        Yet another challeges is the presentation of raw data(not refined perfectly for the view) from  is also  an important challe
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                    Premise

The project developement focused on frontend challenges and skills in vanillaJS() .

The backend service utilizes OMDB api.(https://www.omdbapi.com/)
    Since this a frontend project , I have put all modular functions in one single javascript file.(styles/OMDb.js file)

These modules

The basic design of the app is trivial for someone with good grasp of css basics
in placement of tags.(I have heavily relied on the flex box style).
